Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a captivating cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in the 1970s. It operates on a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell evolves over time based on simple rules, resulting in mesmerizing emergent patterns.
